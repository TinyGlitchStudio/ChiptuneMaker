### ChiptuneMaker
>ChiptuneMaker is a basic chiptune music creator built with Java, using Java MIDI for sound generation and JavaFX for the user interface.



### Todo List

- [x] Replace InputHandler.java (generated by ChatGPT) with a custom interface made by me(This feels like a half-win for me, i swapped the file for an interface, but i used AI too much for it. I really hate JavaFX)
- [ ] Better interface (This might never happen lol)
- [ ] Add note duration control
- [ ] Add support for silences (rests)
- [ ] Implement simultaneous playback
- [ ] Add an export system
- [ ] Create a dynamic Pattern system that users can modify
- [ ] Folder Refactoring?
- [ ] Code Refactoring?
- [ ] Write a how to use
